This C++ application is a sparse matrix with a triplet representation in the form of an array. It does not store zero elements but the row and column number, so consumes less memory than the whole matrix containing zero elements. The 2D matrix is transformed into this space-saving form in the program and the array of rows, columns, and values are shown.

It is also effective when dealing with big matrices and a lot of zeroes in memory and calculation.
